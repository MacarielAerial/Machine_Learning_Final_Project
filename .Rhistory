The overall architecture consists of three dense layers and three dropout layers as well as one final dense layer with one sigmoid computational unit to estimate probability.
The hyperparameters are 20% dropout rate,

The overall architecture consists of three dense layers and three dropout layers as well as one final dense layer with one sigmoid computational unit to estimate probability.
The hyperparameters are 20% dropout rate, 64 batch size and 10 epochs.
*Does your model suffer from underfitting or overfitting? Discuss using plots.*
